In this no extra datastructure will be used 
This contains of 3 parts
Base condition:
It is same in 80%of question:
if root == None:
return 0 
and some changes on the basis of problem

2nd part Hypothesis:
It remains same everytime
left = solve(root.left,res)
right = solve(root.right,res)

3rd part:
Induction:
It has a basic structure but it changes a little bit in every question

temp = func(  ,   )
ans = func(temp,  )
res = func(ans,res)

Induction part works as dp as it is returning the answer of the lower trees and makes a bottom up dp
