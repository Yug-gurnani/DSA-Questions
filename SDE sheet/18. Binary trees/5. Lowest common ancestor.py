"""
Given a Binary Tree with all unique values and two nodes value n1 and n2.
The task is to find the lowest common ancestor of the given two nodes.
We may assume that either both n1 and n2 are present in the tree or none of them is present. 

Example 1:

Input:
n1 = 2 , n2 =  3

     1
   /  \
  2    3
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input:
n1 = 3 , n2 = 4

         5
        /
       2
     /  \
    3    4
Output: 2

The idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with the root,
then the root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If the root doesnâ€™t match with any of the keys,
we recur for the left and right subtree. The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in the right subtree is the LCA.
If both keys lie in the left subtree, then the left subtree has LCA also, otherwise, LCA lies in the right subtree
