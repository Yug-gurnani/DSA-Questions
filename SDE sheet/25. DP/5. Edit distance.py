"""
Given two strings s and t. Find the minimum number of operations that need to be performed on str1 to convert it to str2.
The possible operations are:

Insert
Remove
Replace
 

Example 1:

Input: 
s = "geek", t = "gesek"
Output: 1
Explanation: One operation is required 
inserting 's' between two 'e's of str1.
